We used the tools presented in CS 546: Web Programming to create a well-designed website with a logical database model.

A little bit more about our database...

Users - Where information, such as the username, email address, and *hashed* password is stored
Listings - Information about the listings, including the title, condition, description, and pricing details
Reviews - Users can leave a short description about a reviewer
Offers - Users can leave offers for any listing
Comments - Users can leave comments for listings, creating a chatroom environment
Transactions - mock purchase and trade systems for the users
